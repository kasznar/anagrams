## Problem
The task is to write a CLI program which finds all anagrams of the user's input word in a
dictionary.
1. The dictionary is a plain text file (wordlist.txt) which contains one word per line.
2. The program should handle anagram-requests as fast as possible preferably in constant time.
3. The program should ask for the next user input after printing the previous result.
4. Write a "production ready" code which you'd proudly push to master, preferably with tests.
